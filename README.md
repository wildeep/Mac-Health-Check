# Mac Health Check

> A practical and user-friendly approach to surfacing Mac compliance information directly to end-users via Jamf Pro Self Service

<img src="images/Mac_Health_Check_Hero.png" alt="Mac Health Check Hero" width="600"/>

## Overview

Mac Health Check provides a practical and user-friendly approach to surfacing Mac compliance information directly to end-users via Jamf Pro Self Service.

Built using the open-source utility [swiftDialog](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog/wiki), the solution acts as a “heads-up display” that presents real-time system health and policy compliance status in a clear and interactive format.

Deployment of Mac Health Check involves configuring organizational defaults, embedding the script in Jamf Pro, creating a policy to run it on demand and testing to ensure proper output and behavior.

Administrators can customize the user interface using swiftDialog’s visual capabilities, making the experience both informative and approachable.

The tool logs results for IT review, while not altering device configurations, making it ideal for visibility without intrusion.

## Use Cases

Mac Health Check is particularly valuable in IT support workflows, serving as an initial triage point for Tier 1 support by confirming network access, credentials, and Jamf Pro connectivity, while also acting as a verification tool for Tier 2 teams both during and after remediation efforts.

### Step Zero for Tier 1

- User has a working Internet connection
- User knows their directory credentials
- Mac can execute policies
- Validates Network Access Controls

### Step Ninety-nine for Tier 2

- Initial assessment for support sessions
- Easily confirms remediation efforts
- Provides peace-of-mind for end-users

## Features
The following health checks and information reporting are included and the script operates in “test” mode by default. (Change `operationMode` to `production` when ready to deploy in production.)
